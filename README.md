# JavaScript: Series

Write a program that will take a string of digits and give you all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- 491
- 914
- 142

And the following 4-digit series:

- 4914
- 9142

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions*
in the input; the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

These tests use jasmine-node, which is a testing framework written for Node.js.

You will need:

* Node.js
* The Node Package Manager (NPM)
* jasmine-node

You can install both Node.js and NPM with a download from nodejs.org: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Use NPM to install jasmine-node:

    npm install jasmine-node -g

To work on an exercise, change to the directory of the exercise:

    cd hello-world

This contains the files for the exercise.

    .
    ├── README.md
    └── hello-world.spec.js

To run a test file, pass it as an argument to the `jasmine-node` command:

    jasmine-node hello-world.spec.js
